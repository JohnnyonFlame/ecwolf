November 23th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed mouse movement speed limiter.  I don't know if there are any side
  effects to this.
- Move the jukebox to be after the signon screen.  This is because I was unable
  to access it on my system where it was.  So press M at the signon screen to
  go to the jukebox.
- Removed the duplicate ULTIMATE on the jukebox.  Added all missing tracks.
- Fixed: Strafing didn't apply autorun.

November 19th, 2009
-----------------------------
- I believe I got the rest of the old sound stuff out.

November 18th, 2009
-----------------------------
- All sounds now use the new resource system.
- Removed a large portion of the old sound code which is now unused.

November 17th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Music is now using the new resource code.  I actually did this a while ago
  (probably sometime in august), but apparently I never committed it.

August 9th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed old VGAGRAPH code.

August 8th, 2009
-----------------------------
- DEMOs use the resource system.  You can have up to 10000 demos now.
- Graphics are changed to have the format of a 4 byte header followed by the
  graphic data.  2 bytes for width, 2 bytes for height.  This is done
  on the fly for VGAGRAPH data, but new data must use the new format.
- Quite a few of the graphics are now drawn using the new system.

August 7th, 2009
-----------------------------
- The VGAGRAPH, VGAHEAD, and VGADICT are now loaded by the new resource system 
  and given names at run time.
- The TITEPIC and CREDITS lump are now used. They are 320x200 raw pages similar
  to Heretic's TITLE lump.

June 22nd, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed "Change View" menu (F5 IIRC) and replace it with Doom style in game
  changing with the -/= keys.
- The load/save menus are now using the new system.  Also save slots are
  dynamically created so you're no longer limited to 10.

June 20th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed custom menu handlers in favor of the listeners system since it offers
  order independance with equal flexibility.
- Separated the Adlib sounds and music volume.

June 19th, 2009
-----------------------------

  MenuItems.

-----------------------------
- Tweaked the volume formula again.  It's a lot simpler now.

December 9th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Re-combined the Adlib slider, only this time with the music volume since I 
  figured out that the adlib player latched on the music channel.  I really 
  don't feel like figuring out how to separate them at the moment.
- Continued work on the Menu code.  In the process I was able to remove quite 
  a few #ifdef SPEARs!  This means ECWolf will use a little more memory, but 
  it is worth it.
- Tweaked the volume formula.

- Using Wolf4SDL v1.6 as a base.
