January 2nd, 2010
-----------------------------
- Mostly got rid of the STL and updated the scanner.

December 19th, 2010
-----------------------------
- More reductions in STL use.

December 18th, 2010
-----------------------------
- The DECORATE system now uses more ZDoom classes over the STL. I'll probably
  be changing more code over in the future.

November 18th, 2010
-----------------------------
- Fixed: Scanner would not parse unquoted strings along with tokens.
- Fixed: Config was read too early.

January 18th, 2010
-----------------------------
- Doing more work on the DECORATE system.  In particular I started on doing
  native actors and inheritance.  I believe things are vary slowly falling into
  place now.
- Added video options.
- Moved all of the options into their own submenu.
- Third map plane is now always on.

January 17th, 2010
-----------------------------
- Fixed: Various crashes with the sound code.  I'll be so happy once I can 
  finally isolate all the areas that need #pragma pack(1) set.
- Fixed: CMake didn't check if there was a need to update the pk3.
- Added a dummy decorate reader.  Still haven't quite decided where I'm going 
  with this.

December 13th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Completed the TEXTURES lump thanks to Executor.
- As far as I know, all texture drawing pulls from the Textures lump.

November 29th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Fixed: Somehow the value of lumpNum was changing during the OpenLumpNum call.

November 23th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed mouse movement speed limiter.  I don't know if there are any side
  effects to this.
- Move the jukebox to be after the signon screen.  This is because I was unable
  to access it on my system where it was.  So press M at the signon screen to
  go to the jukebox.
- Removed the duplicate ULTIMATE on the jukebox.  Added all missing tracks.
- Fixed: Strafing didn't apply autorun.

November 19th, 2009
-----------------------------
- I believe I got the rest of the old sound stuff out.

November 18th, 2009
-----------------------------
- All sounds now use the new resource system.
- Removed a large portion of the old sound code which is now unused.

November 17th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Music is now using the new resource code.  I actually did this a while ago
  (probably sometime in august), but apparently I never committed it.
- Added some code to handle the rest of the audio later.

August 9th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed old VGAGRAPH code.

August 8th, 2009
-----------------------------
- DEMOs use the resource system.  You can have up to 10000 demos now.
- Graphics are changed to have the format of a 4 byte header followed by the
  graphic data.  2 bytes for width, 2 bytes for height.  This is done
  on the fly for VGAGRAPH data, but new data must use the new format.
- Quite a few of the graphics are now drawn using the new system.

August 7th, 2009
-----------------------------
- The VGAGRAPH, VGAHEAD, and VGADICT are now loaded by the new resource system
  and given names at run time.
- The TITEPIC and CREDITS lump are now used. They are 320x200 raw pages similar
  to Heretic's TITLE lump.
- Exported the signon screens to the pk3.

July 30th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed Spear of Destiny copy protection quiz.
- Added language lump support.
- Fixed: Crash at intermission.
- Fixed: Typo in language lump with STR_FLOORCOMPLETED which caused a crash.
- Fixed: Save games didn't work under Windows.
- Fixed: Read This didn't work.
- Removed FunctionMenuItem since it was no longer needed.

July 29th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Used ZDoom's file management to export the palettes.
- Added Executor's texture names.

- Fixed: Volume sliders were not saved to the config file.

July 28th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed #pragma pack(1) (among others) from as many source files as possible.
  This fixes some crashes that only appeared in release builds.
- Added some file management code from ZDoom.
- Fixed some problems with the load game menu.
- Fought with Windows.

-----------------------------
- Customize controls menu is now using the new code.  In addition more contorls
  are available.

- Added always run.
- Changed the config system to use an ascii file.

July 26th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Added scrolling code to menus.
- It can now search an entire directory for save games.  (Linux only)
- Fixed Windows compile error.

June 22nd, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed "Change View" menu (F5 IIRC) and replace it with Doom style in game
  changing with the -/= keys.
- The load/save menus are now using the new system.  Also save slots are
  dynamically created so you're no longer limited to 10.

June 20th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed custom menu handlers in favor of the listeners system since it offers
  order independance with equal flexibility.
- Separated the Adlib sounds and music volume.

June 19th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Did a lot of work on the menu system.  I've added a text entry type and
  introduced the concept of listeners to alter the functionality of specific
  MenuItems.

June 17th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Continued menu work, removed old sound devices menu in favor of a more
  flexable multiple choice option.

June 16th, 2009
-----------------------------
- More menu work.  The episode and skill menus are now using the new code.

December 16th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Cleaned up some menu source code.
- Worked on the wolf data maps in preparation to converting the engine to use
  named lumps.
- Added language lump.

December 13th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Fixed issues in Windows.

December 11th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Tweaked the volume formula again.  It's a lot simpler now.

December 9th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Re-combined the Adlib slider, only this time with the music volume since I
  figured out that the adlib player latched on the music channel.  I really
  don't feel like figuring out how to separate them at the moment.
- Continued work on the Menu code.  In the process I was able to remove quite
  a few #ifdef SPEARs!  This means ECWolf will use a little more memory, but
  it is worth it.
- Tweaked the volume formula.

December 6th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Added: Adlib volume slider.
- Added: Volume sliders.  Their values aren't saved yet but at least they are
  there.
- Rewrote part of the menu code to use C++ classes.
- Using Wolf4SDL v1.6 as a base.
