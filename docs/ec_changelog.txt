- Fixed issues in Windows.

- Tweaked the volume formula again.  It's a lot simpler now.

December 9th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Re-combined the Adlib slider, only this time with the music volume since I 
  figured out that the adlib player latched on the music channel.  I really 
  don't feel like figuring out how to separate them at the moment.
- Continued work on the Menu code.  In the process I was able to remove quite 
  a few #ifdef SPEARs!  This means ECWolf will use a little more memory, but 
  it is worth it.
- Tweaked the volume formula.

December 6th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Added: Adlib volume slider.
- Added: Volume sliders.  Their values aren't saved yet but at least they are 
  there.
- Rewrote part of the menu code to use C++ classes.
- Using Wolf4SDL v1.6 as a base.
